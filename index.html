I received a MSc in Computer Science from [Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte](http://www.ufrn.br/en) in 2014. 
My thesis was about Fuzzy Segmentation of Three-Dimensional Objects with Textural Properties, advised by professor 
[Bruno Motta](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?hl=en&user=Bgvt9KYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

Before, I obtained bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, under the supervision of 
professor Bruno Motta, working on texture segmentation. During 1 year, I was also a undergraduate Geophysics student at the same 
university.

My primary research goal is to develop new methods to understand image and shapes, in a way it becomes easier for everyone to create 
and edit digital content in real time - images, textures, and meshes. I'm also interested in how Machine Learning can be used to 
emulate and speed up physical behaviors.

Currently I divide my time at UFRN between the Imagina Research Lab and a job as students coordinator at the Master's of Economics.

Rays
--------

This [code](https://github.com/netolcc06/Rays) reads a polygon with n vertices $(vx, vy) / (-1 <= v_x <= 1)$ and $(-1 <= v_y <= 1)$ and generates 64 lines that
may or not cross the polygon. The parts of the lines inside the polygon are colored green and the outside parts are colored gray.

Ray Tracer
--------

![     ](pics/spheres.jpg width="40%")
It is mandatory for everyone interested in graphics to implement a ray tracer. 
This is a C++ implementation based on the new ray tracer guru Peter Shirley's book series. 
The implementation covers basic dieletric, diffuse and metal materials. As one could infer from the picture, 
refraction and reflection were implemented. Besides that, I added boxes, planes, and triangle meshes structures. 
You can check my code at [Baby Ray Tracer](https://github.com/netolcc06/BabyRayTracer). For the future: 
Bounding Volume Hierarchies, textures and light emiting objects.


Mesh-IO
--------

![     ](pics/dragon.png width="40%")
In the Geometry Processing course I took during my Masters, the professor suggested to the students using 
the [OpenMesh](https://www.openmesh.org/) to work on the projects of the class. Basically the professor provided a basis 
code and we should implement a specific algorithm, such as the marching cubes. It happens that I didn't like the way OpenMesh 
was designed, since I had considered it too verbose for simple algorithms at that time - I don't know its current state. 
Given that, I developed a few C++ classes to handle a 3D mesh structure which provides direct accsess to vertices, 
half-edges and faces. See the implementation here. Nowadays I know libigl, therefore I have no reasons to use my own code. 
However, I had a lot of fun designing my Mesh structure - take a look at 
my [Mesh.h](https://github.com/netolcc06/Triangulating/blob/master/Mesh.h) and you'll see the trick.
