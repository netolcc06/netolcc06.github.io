I am a Computing Science PhD student at Simon Fraser University, working as part of the [GruVi](http://gruvi.cs.sfu.ca/) team under supervision 
  of Prof. Hao (Richard) Zhang and Prof. Kangkang Yin (Co-Senior Supervisor).
  
I received BSc and MSc degrees in Computer Science from [Federal University at Rio Grande do Norte](http://www.ufrn.br/en), advised by professor 
[Bruno Motta](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?hl=en&user=Bgvt9KYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) working on image segmentation. 
  During one year, I was also an undergraduate Geophysics student at the same institution.

  _Abstract_: Chronic Wounds are ulcers presenting a difficult or nearly interrupted cicatrization process, and increase the risk of 
  complications to the health and well-being of patients, like amputation and infections. The goal of this research is the 
  development of a general noninvasive methodology for the segmentation and analysis of chronic wounds images by computing the 
  wound areas affected by necrosis. Invasive techniques are usually used for this calculation, such as manual planimetry with 
  plastic films. We investigated algorithms to perform the segmentation of wounds as well as the use of several convolutional 
  networks for classifying tissue as Necrotic, Granulation or Slough. We tested four architectures: U-Net, Segnet, FCN8 and FCN32, 
  and proposed a color space reduction methodology that increased the reported accuracies, specificities, sensitivities and 
  Dice coefficients for all 4 networks, achieving very good levels.

 _Abstract_: Digital image segmentation is the process of assigning distinct labels to different objects in a digital image, 
  and the fuzzy segmentation algorithm has been successfully used in the segmentation of images from a wide variety of 
  sources. However, the traditional fuzzy segmentation algorithm fails to segment objects that are characterized by textures 
  whose patterns cannot be successfully described by simple statistics computed over a very restricted area. In this paper, 
  we propose an extension of the fuzzy segmentation algorithm that uses adaptive textural affinity functions to perform the 
  segmentation of such objects on bidimensional images. The adaptive affinity functions compute their appropriate 
  neighborhood size as they compute the texture descriptors surrounding the seed spels (spatial elements), according to 
  the characteristics of the texture being processed. The algorithm then segments the image with an appropriate neighborhood 
  for each object. We performed experiments on mosaic images that were composed using images from the Brodatz database, 
  and compared our results with the ones produced by a recently published texture segmentation algorithm, showing the 
  applicability of our method.

_Abstract_: Video segmentation can be defined as the process of partitioning video into spatio-temporal objects that are 
  homogeneous in some feature space, with the choice of features being very important to the success of the segmentation 
  process. Fuzzy segmentation is a semi-automatic region-growing segmentation algorithm that assigns to each element in an 
  image a grade of membership in an object. In this paper, we propose an extension of the multi-object fuzzy segmentation 
  algorithm to segment pre-acquired color video shots. The color features are selected from channels belonging to 
  different color models using two different heuristics: one that uses the correlations between the color channels 
  to maximize the amount of information used in the segmentation process, and one that chooses the color channels based 
  on the separation of the clusters formed by the seed spels for all possible color spaces. Motion information is also 
  incorporated into the segmentation process by making use of dense optical flow maps. We performed experiments on 
  synthetic videos, with and without noise, as well as on some real videos. The experiments show promising results, 
  with the segmentations of real videos produced using hybrid color spaces being more accurate than the ones produced 
  using three other color models. We also show that our method compares favorably to a state-of-the art video segmentation 
  algorithm.

Ray Tracer
--------

![     ](pics/spheres.jpg width="40%")
It is mandatory for everyone interested in graphics to implement a ray tracer. 
This is a C++ implementation based on the new ray tracer guru Peter Shirley's book series. 
The implementation covers basic dieletric, diffuse and metal materials. As one could infer from the picture, 
refraction and reflection were implemented. Besides that, I added boxes, planes, and triangle meshes structures. 
You can check my code at [Baby Ray Tracer](https://github.com/netolcc06/BabyRayTracer). For the future: 
Bounding Volume Hierarchies, textures and light emiting objects.  
  
Rays
--------

![     ](pics/rays.png width="40%")
This [algorithm](https://github.com/netolcc06/Rays) takes a polygon with $n$ vertices $(v_x, v_y) \mid (-1 \leq v_x \leq 1)$ and 
$(-1 \leq v_y \leq 1)$ as input and generates $64$ lines that may or not cross the polygon. The parts of the lines inside the polygon 
are colored green and the outside parts are colored gray.
Basically, if a line is inside the screen space, it contains at least $2$ intersection points.
If the line intersects the polygon, it will have more than $2$ intersection points.
Since the first and the last points intersect walls of the screen/window space, all the other points
come from intersections with the given polygon.
Then, as example, taking a line that has $4$ intersection points $(p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3)$, $p_0p_1$ is outside the polygon,
$p_1p_2$ is inside the polygon, and $p_2p_3$ is outside the polygon - $p_0$ and $p_3$ are the intersections with the
screen/window space.
My solution has one flaw. When a line intersects a polygon right at one of its corners without getting inside
of the polygon itself, it will change the color line anyway. I didn't get a simple solution for this for
myself. If the polygon was restricted to be convex, this issue would be simplified. You can find detailed discussions
about my solution by reading the comments in the class [Line](https://github.com/netolcc06/Rays/blob/master/Line.hpp).

Maze

the exit path is found (and highlighted) via backtracking.

Mesh-IO
--------

![     ](pics/dragon.png width="40%")
In the Geometry Processing course I took during my Masters, the professor suggested we used 
the [OpenMesh](https://www.openmesh.org/) to work on the projects of the class. Essentially the professor provided a basis 
code and we should implement a specific algorithm, such as the marching cubes. It happens that I didn't like the way OpenMesh 
was designed, since I had considered it too verbose for simple algorithms at that time - I don't know its current state. 
Given that, I developed a few C++ classes to handle a 3D mesh structure which provides direct access to vertices, 
half-edges and faces. See the implementation [here](https://github.com/netolcc06/Triangulating). Nowadays I know libigl, therefore I have no reasons to use my own code. 
However, I had a lot of fun designing my Mesh structure - take a look at 
my [Mesh.h](https://github.com/netolcc06/Triangulating/blob/master/Mesh.h) and you'll see the trick.
