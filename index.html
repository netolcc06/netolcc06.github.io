I received a MSc in Computer Science from Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte in 2014. My thesis was about Fuzzy Segmentation of Three-Dimensional Objects with Textural Properties, advised by professor Bruno Motta.

Before, I obtained bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, under the supervision of professor Bruno Motta, working on texture segmentation. During 1 year, I was also a undergraduate Geophysics student at the same university.

My main area of research is Computer Graphics and  my primary research goal is to understand how different materials can be computationally modelled, in a way it becomes easier for everyone to create and edit digital content - images, textures, meshes and animations!

Currently I divide my time at UFRN between the Imagina Research Lab and a job as students coordinator at the Master's of Economics.

Ray Tracer

It is mandatory for everyone interested in graphics to implement a ray tracer. This is a C++ implementation based on the new ray tracer guru Peter Shirley's book series. The implementation covers basic dieletric, diffuse and metal materials. As one could infer from the picture, refraction and reflection were implemented. ​Besides that, I added boxes, planes, and triangle meshes as structures. You can check my code on Baby Ray Tracer. I am going to add in a near future: Bounding Volume Hierarchies, textures and light emiting objects.

Mesh-IO

During the Geometry Processing course I took during my Masters, the professor suggested to the students using the OpenMesh to work on the projects of the class. Basically the professor provided a basis code and we should implement a specific algorithm, such as the marching cubes. It happens that I didn't like the way OpenMesh was designed, since I had considered it too verbose for simple algorithms at that time - I don't know its current state. Given that, I developed a few C++ classes to handle a 3D mesh structure which provides direct accsess to vertices, half-edges and faces. See the implementation here. Nowadays I know libigl, therefore I have no reasons to use my own code. However, I had a lot of fun designing my Mesh structure - take a look at my Mesh.h and you'll see the trick.
