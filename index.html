I received a MSc in Computer Science from [Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte](http://www.ufrn.br/en) in 2014. 
My thesis was about Fuzzy Segmentation of Three-Dimensional Objects with Textural Properties, advised by professor 
[Bruno Motta](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?hl=en&user=Bgvt9KYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

Before, I obtained bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, under the supervision of 
professor Bruno Motta, working on image segmentation. During 1 year, I was also a undergraduate Geophysics student at the same 
university.

My primary research goal is to develop new methods to understand image and shapes, in a way it becomes easier for everyone to create 
and edit digital content in real time. I'm also interested in how Machine Learning can be used to emulate and speed up physical behaviors.

Currently I divide my time at UFRN between the Imagina Research Lab and a job as students coordinator at the Master's of Economics.

This [algorithm](https://github.com/netolcc06/Rays) takes a polygon with $n$ vertices $(v_x, v_y) \mid (-1 \leq v_x \leq 1)$ and 
$(-1 \leq v_y \leq 1)$ as input and generates $64$ lines that may or not cross the polygon. The parts of the lines inside the polygon 
are colored green and the outside parts are colored gray.
Basically, if a line is inside the screen space, it contains at least $2$ intersection points.
If the line intersects the polygon, it will have more than $2$ intersection points.
Since the first and the last points intersect walls of the screen/window space, all the other points
come from intersections with the given polygon.
Then, as example, taking a line that has $4$ intersection points $(p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3)$, $p_0p_1$ is outside the polygon,
$p_1p_2$ is inside the polygon, and $p_2p_3$ is outside the polygon - $p_0$ and $p_3$ are the intersections with the
screen/window space.
My solution has one flaw. When a line intersects a polygon right at one of its corners without getting inside
of the polygon itself, it will change the color line anyway. I didn't get a simple solution for this for
myself. If the polygon was restricted to be convex, this issue would be simplified. You can find detailed discussions
about my solution by reading the comments in the class [Line](https://github.com/netolcc06/Rays/blob/master/Line.hpp).

Maze
--------
[Randomized maze generation](https://github.com/netolcc06/Maze) using Kruskal's Algorithm. After the maze is generated, 
the exit path is found(and highlighted) via backtracking.

Ray Tracer
--------

![     ](pics/spheres.jpg width="40%")
It is mandatory for everyone interested in graphics to implement a ray tracer. 
This is a C++ implementation based on the new ray tracer guru Peter Shirley's book series. 
The implementation covers basic dieletric, diffuse and metal materials. As one could infer from the picture, 
refraction and reflection were implemented. Besides that, I added boxes, planes, and triangle meshes structures. 
You can check my code at [Baby Ray Tracer](https://github.com/netolcc06/BabyRayTracer). For the future: 
Bounding Volume Hierarchies, textures and light emiting objects.


Mesh-IO
--------

![     ](pics/dragon.png width="40%")
In the Geometry Processing course I took during my Masters, the professor suggested to the students using 
the [OpenMesh](https://www.openmesh.org/) to work on the projects of the class. Basically the professor provided a basis 
code and we should implement a specific algorithm, such as the marching cubes. It happens that I didn't like the way OpenMesh 
was designed, since I had considered it too verbose for simple algorithms at that time - I don't know its current state. 
Given that, I developed a few C++ classes to handle a 3D mesh structure which provides direct accsess to vertices, 
half-edges and faces. See the implementation [here](https://github.com/netolcc06/Triangulating). Nowadays I know libigl, therefore I have no reasons to use my own code. 
However, I had a lot of fun designing my Mesh structure - take a look at 
my [Mesh.h](https://github.com/netolcc06/Triangulating/blob/master/Mesh.h) and you'll see the trick.
